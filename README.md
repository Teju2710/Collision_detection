# Collision_detection
## Introduction
Car Collision Detection System using Verilog, aimed at simulating the hardware logic necessary for detecting potential vehicle collisions in real-time. The system operates by monitoring key parameters such as the distance between vehicles and their relative speeds. When the system detects an impending collision, it triggers alerts or engages appropriate safety mechanisms, which could include braking assistance or warning signals, to help prevent accidents.

The design is implemented virtually using Vivado, where the hardware description language (HDL) code is synthesized and simulated to validate its functionality. The Verilog code defines the logic for analyzing sensor inputs and speed data to calculate the likelihood of a collision. Testbenches are included to simulate various scenarios, such as different vehicle speeds, distances, and reaction times, ensuring the system's accuracy and responsiveness.

This project has potential applications in autonomous vehicles and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), where real-time collision detection is crucial for improving road safety. The repository contains the complete Verilog codebase, testbenches, and simulation results, providing a comprehensive overview of the system's design and performance. Through this virtual implementation, the project demonstrates how hardware logic can be utilized in the development of safety-critical automotive systems.
